**Warning**: Be absolutely sure you understand the contents of this program before you run it. The program has the ability to write to files and remove directories.

Note: dirent.h and unistd.h cme with the C POSIX library, but are not included in visual studio. To run the files, use an IDE that supports dirent.h and unistd.h

This is a small custom shell intended to mimic other shells.
